    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A variation from usual pancake recipes, this banana pancake is healthy and gluten-free! The pancake uses <em>tapioca</em> <br>
      flour (originated from the <em>cassava</em> plant) and oat as it's main batter ingredient, making the use of wheat flour unnecessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large banana (or alternatively 2 small bananas)</li>
      <li>1 table spoon of tapioca starch / tapioca flour</li>
      <li>2 table spoons of oat flakes</li>
      <li>2 whole eggs</li>
      <li>1 tea spoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, mash the banana with a fork until smooth.</li>
      <li>Mix in the tapioca and oat flakes.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract and whisk until a smooth batter forms.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a non-stick preheated skillet and cook until the under side is golden brown.</li>
      <li>Flip the pancake and reach golden brown color on the other side.</li>
      <li>You are ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cooking tip: serve the pancake folded in half with banana slices or peanut butter.</p>
