# Odin Recipes Project
This is the first project from TOP, from the HTML Foundations section of the course.
It is comprized of a simple recipe website using HTML's basics only (Headers, Paragraphs, Bold, Italic, Lists, Links, Images).
### Pre-project goals:
My goal is to practice HTML and make a simple yet creative website with the recipes I make with my girlfriend.
### Post-project reflection:
In this project I was able to put into practice the knowledge I learned so far, as well as new ideas of how to use HTML in a creative way, such as integrating images with links. This helped me to further solidify my knowledge.
